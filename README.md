# CsharpQuests

Repo for the C# guild hosted by [Simon Renger](https://github.com/simonrenger), for education at [BUAS](https://www.buas.nl/en/programmes/creative-media-and-game-technologies).

This was a course I took during my education at Breda University of Applied Sciences, to create a basic knowledge of C#.
